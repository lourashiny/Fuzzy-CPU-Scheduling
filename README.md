# Fuzzy-CPU-Scheduling
Scheduling is a key process to be carried out by the Operating System. To begin with, the different types of basic scheduling algorithms will be compared with each other.  Artificial intelligence is an ever-expanding domain. Through AI machines can learn from experience and will have the ability to deal with uncertainty making scheduling more optimal. Fuzzy Logic is one of the best ways to implement AI in OS scheduling. There are a few existing works on how Fuzzy Logic can be applied in OS Scheduling. This is a proposed scheduling algorithm using Fuzzy Logic from existing works.
